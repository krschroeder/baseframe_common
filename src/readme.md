# Base_Frame Plugins

It's nearly inevitable your website will need these plugin's and JS functionality, so here they are. You'll notice some are missing (like a carousel for example), that's because there are just some really, realy well made, IMO. Not touching that stuff, use those others, they're great. Others I always thought could be better, even though a few are frankly near duplicates ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Anyways here we are, and you're stil reading this! If you download you probably work where I do, or somehow stumbled across.

## Runs with [Cash](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/cash) (or JQuery if you wish)

These are made to work with [Cash](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/cash) (with jQuery still an option) as the only dependency. Cash in its own terms is 'Cash is an absurdly small jQuery alternative for modern browsers (IE11+) that provides jQuery-style syntax for manipulating the DOM'. In my opinion, having a DOM traversing Library is essential. While it adds code to the page, saves you the hassle of writing extra. Also, everybody who's done any web developement is familiar with jQuery syntax. But the weight of it is a little too much if you ask me, so instead we use __Cash__.

## Some nice features are their is some shared syntax in the way they all operate. 

__For Example:__ all have options that can be plugged in as a data attribute, in JSON format (loosely written somehat)
```html
    <div id="your-plugin-elem" data-plugin-name="{option:'text',option2: true, etc: 'you get the idea'}"></div>
```

<p><strong>For Example:</strong> all can have their configuration change. Which can come in handy sometimes when things get complex</p>
    
```javascript
    $('.your-plugin-elem').PluginOfSorts({change:'yep', height: 1e6})
```

## Example of Importing In
```javascript
//lets bring it all on in
import installStoreToLibrary, {
    libraryExtend,
    Collapse,
    EqualizeContent,
    MarketoForm,
    NavDesktop,
    NavMobile,
    NavMobileNestled,
    Parallax,
    Popup,
    ResponsiveDropDown,
    Tabs
} from 'base_frame/@plugins';

//necessary for all plugin's to operate
//much like jQuery's $.data method, the $.store is similar
installStoreToLibrary();

//perhaps for some reason you don't want to install
//but here we obviously are
libraryExtend([
    Collapse,
    EqualizeContent,
    NavDesktop,
    NavMobile,
    Parallax,
    Popup,
    ResponsiveDropDown,
    Tabs
]); 
```
